                I've spent most of my career in the aviation industry, mainly focusing in aviation maintenance.
                I hold my Airframe and Powerplant License (A&P) issued by the Federal Aviation Administration. I 
                graduated from Aviation Institute of Maintenace located at the Northeast Philadelphia Airport in
                2007 and quickly got a job at Hortman Aviation as a junior Mechanic. I was one of two women in maintenance.
                Most of my experience lies in general aviation, working on 2 to 8 place aircraft, for flight schools
                and repair stations.<br><br>
                I wanted to switch industries to have a more challenging upward career that is based on the quality
                of my work and less on office politics. I would also like to have a more flexible schedule now that
                my kid is in school. I started to teach myself HTML and CSS through freecodecamp.org and a few courses 
                through Coursera. I applied to the UPenn/Trilogy Bootcamp because I do better in a structured environment.
                I really want this to work out and so I am putting a lot of energy into switching to this industry.
                I am excited to once again take my fate back into my hands. <br><br>
                I am a bit worried about Javascript and the backend structure as it will be completely new to me, 
                but I have faith in the Bootcamp and my classmates. I believe we will all get through this together, 
                helping each other through graduation. My husband works in the IT industry and he claims that it is 
                a pretty small world. So I know we will all meet again after graduation!
